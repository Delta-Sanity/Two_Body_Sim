# Two_Body_Sim

The goal of this project is to simulate the paths created by two massive bodies with an initial position and velocity (p_1 and v_1) and simulate the position and velocity of those particles at time t. By simulating the motion both mathematically and computationally, a prediction of error in computer simulation of the n-body problem may be made. 

As of January 2023, only the computational simulation has been completed. I am still learning the vector calculus and SymPy required to solve the mathematical simulation. I aim to have the mathematical simulation done by mid-march 2023.

I have additional code to handle XML files used to store particle paths, but I don't think it is stable enough to release right now.
